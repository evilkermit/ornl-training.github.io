The course will be based on the excellent [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) 
curriculum and will incorporate pair-programming and live coding. The course will take a
student-centered, active learning, approach to teaching this material. Class
will typically consist of a short introductions to programming techniques, followed by 
hands on computing exercises.
