The Advanced Scientific Programming with Python and C++ is aimed at providing 
scientist with in-depth skills necessary to use Python and C++ for scientific 
computing. In particular the course will cover:

Basics:

* Understanding the shell
* Using Git and GitHub
* Best-practice software engineering techniques

Python:

* Introduction to Python 3.5
* The NumPy and Pandas data analysis libraries
* The Jupyter and PyDev development environments
* The Matplotlib 2D plotting library 

C++:

* Introduction to C++--14
* The CDT development environment
* Using Makefiles
* The standard library and STL

The course will be based on the excellent [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) 
curriculum and will incorporate pair-programming and live coding. The course will take a
student-centered, active learning, approach to teaching this material. Class
will typically consist of a short introductions to programming techniques, followed by 
hands on computing exercises.
