title: Plotting 2 - Contour plotting 2
---

In the first exercise, we loaded data from a text file and used the data to generate a contour
plot. However, the plot was pretty basic, so this exercise is to make it more readable.

Using the [Pyplot documentation](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/pyplot_summary.html), see if
you can work out how to do the following tasks:

- Add a title to the plot
- Add X and Y labels to the axes
- Add labels to the contours
- Add a colorbar
