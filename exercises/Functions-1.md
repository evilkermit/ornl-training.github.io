title: Functions 1 - Defining functions
---

We want to make the program you wrote in the plotting exercises reusable by splitting it into two functions. 
The first function should produce a contour plot of a data file. The second function should add the various
elements to the plot, such as the contour labels, a color bar, etc. Choose meaningful names for the functions,
and provide parameters so that they can be usefully reused. Add extra features if you think it would be useful.

Make sure you add doc strings to the functions, and add comments in the code where appropriate.

Once you've defined the functions, add some code at the end of the program to call them to create the plot.

A solution to this exercise is available [here]({{ site.github.url }}/code/plot_func.py).
