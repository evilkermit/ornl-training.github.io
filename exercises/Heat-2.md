title: Heat 2 - 2-D Heat Transfer Model
---

Now we have the basic computation you developed in [the previous exercise]({{ site.github.url }}/exercises/Heat-1), we would like to modify it
to calculate the value of $$ T $$ for a range of $$ x $$ and $$ y $$ values.

Using your knowledge of looping structures in C++, modify the program to iterate over the values of $$ x $$ in the range $$ [-30, 10] $$ and the values of $$ y $$ in the range $$ [-20, 20] $$. For this exercise, use every integer value in the ranges. i.e. ($$ -30, -29, ... $$).

<!-- A solution to this exercise is available [here]({{ site.github.url }}/code/heat_2.cpp).-->
