scientific computing. In particular the course will cover:

Basics:

* Understanding the shell
* Using Git and GitHub

Python:

* Introduction to Python
* The IPython and PyDev development environments

C++:

* Introduction to C++
* Compiling and running programs
* Using Makefiles

The course will be based on the excellent [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) 
curriculum and will incorporate pair-programming and live coding. The course will take a
student-centered, active learning, approach to teaching this material. Class
will typically consist of a short introductions to programming techniques, followed by
