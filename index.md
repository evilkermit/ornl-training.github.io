This is the website for ORNL's Python and C++ programming courses for scientists. 

* [Scientific Programming with Python and C++ (short course)]({{ page.url | prepend: site.github.url }}programming)
* [Scientific Programming with Python and C++ (long course)]({{ page.url | prepend: site.github.url }}advanced)

The goal of these courses is to teach scientists how to use computers more
effectively to make their research easier. We avoid a lot of the theory that is
taught in introductory computer science classes in favor of covering more of the
practical side of programming that is necessary for conducting research. 

These course actively integrate
with [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) and
[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org).
