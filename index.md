This is the website for ORNL's training courses for scientists. 

Currently the following courses are available:

* [ORNL Software Carpentry Workshop](https://ornl-training.github.io/2024-07-23-ORNL/)

The goal of these courses is to teach scientists how to use computers more
effectively to make their research easier. We avoid a lot of the theory that is
taught in introductory computer science classes in favor of covering more of the
practical side of programming and data analysis that is necessary for conducting research. 

These course actively integrate
with [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) and
[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org).
