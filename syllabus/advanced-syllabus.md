#### DS-GA 3001, 3 Credits, Syllabus and Schedule, Spring 2017

#### Professor

Dr. Gregory Watson

Office: 6th Floor, 60 Fifth Ave

Email (best way to contact me):
[greg.watson@nyu.edu](mailto:greg.watson@nyu.edu)


#### Meeting Times & Location

Lecture: Wed 3:30 pm – 5:10 pm, SILV 405

Lab: Thu 7:45 pm - 8:35 pm, 60 Fifth Ave, 110

#### Office Hours

Times: Tue 1:30 – 3:30 pm or by appointment.

Location: 6th Floor, 60 Fifth Ave

*Note: my schedule gets very busy during the semester so please try to
schedule appointments as far in advance as possible. In general it will
be very difficult to set up appointments less than 24 hours in advance.*


#### Text Books

There is no primary textbook for the course. The following texts provide very useful information:

* Introduction to Parallel Computing, Ananth Grama, Anshul Gupta, George Karypis, Vipin Kumar, Pearson; 2 edition (January 26, 2003), ISBN 978-0201648652
* Big Data: Principles and best practices of scalable realtime data systems, 1st Edition, Nathan Marz, James Warren, ISBN 978-1617290343

We will also be using the
excellent [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) lectures
as our primary material.

#### Course Goals

1.  Be able to write relatively advanced, well structured, computer
    programs in Python
2.  Be familiar with principles and techniques for for optimizing the performance of Python numeric applications
3.  Understand parallel computing and how parallel applications can be written in Python
4.  Experiment with developing GPU accelerated Python applications
5.  Develop Python applications that utilize big data services such as Hadoop and Spark
    
#### Website

The syllabus and other relevant class information and resources will be posted
at [{{ site.github.url }}]({{ site.github.url }}).
Changes to the schedule will be posted to this site so please try to check it
periodically for updates.


#### Course Management Email List

In order to provide timely updates and helpful material to students, and
to request feedback from students during the semester, I maintain a
course email list. On the first day of class you will provide your
preferred email for this list. Students are required to be aware of
emails sent to this list.


#### Grading

Grading for this course will be based on successful completion of the weekly
assignments (100%).

There will be weekly programming assignments conducted during the Lab and submitted
prior to the end of the Lab session. Assignments will be submitted using GitHub
(after we've learned about it in class). The lowest scoring assignment will be
dropped. One problem from each assignment (selected at my discretion after the
assignments have been submitted) will receive a thorough code review and a
detailed grade. Other problems will be graded as follows:

*   Produces the correct answer using the requested approach: 100%
*   Generally uses the right approach, but a minor mistake results in an
    incorrect answer: 90%
*   Attempts to solve the problem and makes some progress using the core
    concept: 50%
*   Answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the core concept: 0%

Final grades will be assigned based on the following scale:

-   **A 93-100**
-   **A- 90-92**
-   **B+ 87-89**
-   **B 83-86**
-   **B- 80-82**
-   **C+ 77-79**
-   **C 73-76**
-   **C- 70-72**
-   **D+ 67-69**
-   **D 60-66**
-   **F <60**


#### Student’s Responsibilities

Students are expected to read/view assigned material prior to the class for
which they are scheduled, attend class, participate in class, complete
assignments, complete projects, and ask for help early if they are having
trouble.


#### Instructor’s Responsibilities

I expect myself to read/view the assigned material prior to the class for which
they are scheduled, prepare and deliver high quality introductions to the
material, prepare exercises and assignments that are relevant to research in
data science, and provide comments on assignments and projects intended to help
students develop their abilities to work with computers and data.


#### Academic Honesty

NYU students and faculty to maintain the
highest standards of academic honesty. Students can find information on
the core principles and standards in the university's policy on academic integrity,
which is accessible at
[http://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html](http://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html).


#### Class and Classroom Manners

I do not take attendance and therefore I expect that if you are in class
you are here to learn. So, please, turn off your cell phones, resist the
urge to send email and text messages, etc. Basically I’m just asking
that you be respectful of your fellow students and myself. This class is
a collaborative learning experience. If you have already finished with
what we are working on then find another student to help.


#### Fairness

I will do my absolute best to make this a fair class. If you are having
problems in the class, or just not doing as well as you would like, I
strongly encourage you to approach me as soon as possible to get help
during the semester. Please do not approach me at the end of the
semester and ask me to change your grade, allow you to do extra credit,
etc. Your grade will be the one you have earned and I am ethically
required to report that grade. Of course if I’ve made a mistake grading,
I encourage you to let me know.
